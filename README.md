**About project**:
------------------------------------------

This project contains web aplication for computing TSP in paraler machines
by using MPI and simulated annealing algorithm.

Application structure
---------------------
Application contains three parts.

1. Computing algorithm:

  Python language mpi4py library
  
2. Server side
  
  Python language, flask microframework

3. User side

  HTML, JAVASCRIPT
  
Application functionality
-------------------------

1. Creating single, private users tasks by uploading .txt file with
  traveling salesman towns coordinates
2. Computing those points using simulated annealing algorithm on paraler machines
3. Showing users tasks proggress in real time
4. Drawning inserted and computed points on canvas
5. Drawning inserted and computed path in canvas

Instalation
-----------

To run application you need to have python, flask and all needed libraries installed on your machine.
